If such Repair or Cleaning request is verified by Uber at their reasonable discretion, Uber reserves the right to facilitate payment using your Account and are non-refundable.\n\nBut Uber doesn't outline what would constitute more than normal wear and tear and what wouldnâ€™t.  Their vagueness about this makes it seem like they can charge you for non-specified damages and without proof."
