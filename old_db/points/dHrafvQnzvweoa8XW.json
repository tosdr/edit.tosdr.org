    "tldr": "Tinder’s security disclaimer for privacy warns of unguaranteed secure service, but does provide link to prevent identity theft.\n\nThey say that no system can be completely secure and that they do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, chats, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should take care of how they handle and disclose personal information by avoiding sending personal information through insecure email. Tinder tells you to refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft."
