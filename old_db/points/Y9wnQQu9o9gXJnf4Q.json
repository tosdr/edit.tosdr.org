Their Responsible Disclosure outlines What Vulnerabilities Qualify for the Bounty and what won’t.  However, the awards will vary and are at Groupon’s discretion. If multiple vulnerabilities are reported or are closely related, they may choose to only award a single bounty, or will not award with launch of new products during a beta period.  They also reserve the right to cancel or modify this program at any time and without notice."
