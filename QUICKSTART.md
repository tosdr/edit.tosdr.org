## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository with: `git clone
git@github.com:tosdr/edit.tosdr.org.git` in your working folder.

2. Go to the folder: `cd edit.tosdr.org`.

3. If you are on linux run `sh INSTALL_linux.sh` in your terminal. If you are on
macOS run `sh INSTALL_mac.sh`.

4. Fix the Internet's biggest lie.

## Manual environment setup

### Install Ruby with [Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)

(shamelessly copied from Rbenv doc)

#### Basic GitHub Checkout

This will get you going with the latest version of rbenv without needing
a systemwide install.

1. Clone rbenv into `~/.rbenv`.

    ~~~ sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
    ~~~

    Optionally, try to compile dynamic bash extension to speed up rbenv. Don't
    worry if it fails; rbenv will still work normally:

    ~~~
    $ cd ~/.rbenv && src/configure && make -C src
    ~~~

2. Add `~/.rbenv/bin` to your `$PATH` for access to the `rbenv`
   command-line utility.

    ~~~ sh
    $ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    ~~~

    **Ubuntu Desktop note**: Modify your `~/.bashrc` instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

    **Zsh note**: Modify your `~/.zshrc` file instead of `~/.bash_profile`.

3. Run `~/.rbenv/bin/rbenv init` and follow the instructions to set up
   rbenv integration with your shell. This is the step that will make
   running `ruby` "see" the Ruby version that you choose with rbenv.

4. Restart your shell so that PATH changes take effect. (Opening a new
   terminal tab will usually do it.)

5. Install [ruby-build][], which provides the `rbenv install` command.
   ~~~ sh
   mkdir -p "$(rbenv root)"/plugins
   git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git "$(rbenv root)"/plugins/ruby-build
   ~~~

6. Verify that rbenv is properly set up using this
   [rbenv-doctor](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/blob/master/bin/rbenv-doctor) script:

    ~~~ sh
    $ curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/master/bin/rbenv-doctor | bash
    Checking for `rbenv' in PATH: /usr/local/bin/rbenv
    Checking for rbenv shims in PATH: OK
    Checking `rbenv install' support: /usr/local/bin/rbenv-install (ruby-build 20170523)
    Counting installed Ruby versions: none
      There aren't any Ruby versions installed under `~/.rbenv/versions'.
      You can install Ruby versions like so: rbenv install 2.2.4
    Checking RubyGems settings: OK
    Auditing installed plugins: OK
    ~~~

### When it's done

Install Rails, Postgres, Yarn, etc

    sudo apt install rails postgresql libpq-dev build-essential libssl-dev libreadline-dev zlib1g-dev
    curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install yarn

In your code directory run:

    git clone https://github.com/tosdr/edit.tosdr.org
    cd edit.tosdr.org
    rbenv install 2.6.5
    rbenv local 2.6.5
    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    yarn
    rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
    rails s

And you're ready to code !

## Test your pull requests with a copy of the live data

This requires Heroku access, and is not easy to do if you use Docker compose, but if you can, please copy the live data to your local instance (important if you want to test your PRs!), run the following in your local phoenix repo:

```sh
sh ./db/download.sh
rails s
```

## Automated environment setup

If you have installed [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), getting the application running involves two one-time steps, after which it can be started with a single command in the future.

To prepare the application, run the following two commands inside the repository folder to build it and then initialise the database:

    $ docker-compose build
    $ docker-compose run web bash -c "sleep 1; rails db:create db:migrate"

From then on, you can start the application by running:

    $ docker-compose up

(Add the `--build` argument if you add or remove dependencies.)

To import a database dump from Heroku:

```sh
rm latest.dump
heroku pg:backups:capture --app edit-tosdr-org
heroku pg:backups:download --app edit-tosdr-org
docker-compose run db pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -d phoenix_development -h db -U postgres --no-password /app/latest.dump
docker-compose run web rails db:migrate
```

## Committing & Pull Requests

* If it's a fix use [fix] as a prefix of your message, if it's an enhancement, use [enh], [mod] if it's a modification, [sec] if it's security.
* When you create a pull request, please make sure you checked everything in the PR template.

Have fun!
